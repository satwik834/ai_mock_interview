 Donald  Trump  has  appended  US  policy  in  six  months. (3.04-6.56)
 Conventional  wisdom  is  out. (6.84-8.10)
 Trumpian  logic  is  in. (8.60-9.58)
 It's  most  visible  in  his  India  policy. (10.16-12.46)
 You  see,  India  and  the  US  were  not  always  friends. (13.34-15.80)
 We  started  off  on  the  wrong  foot. (16.16-17.40)
 Washington  supported  Pakistan  in  the  20th  century  and  India  was  closer  to  Moscow. (17.60-21.34)
 Things  only  started  improving  in  the  1990s  when  the  cold  war  finally  ended. (22.00-26.32)
 Successive  governments  tried  to  deepen  ties  between  India  and  the  US. (26.90-30.12)
 They  tried  to  overcome  the  historical  roadblocks. (30.34-32.92)
 Enter  Trump  2 .0. (33.80-35.08)
 India  was  happy  to  see  him  return  to  the  White  House. (35.98-38.26)
 But  what  did  we  get  in  return? (38.66-39.80)
 Gripling  tariffs. (40.60-41.46)
 India  faces  25 %  reciprocal  tariffs  plus  another  25 %  for  buying  Russian  oil. (42.22-47.20)
 So  in  total,  50 %  tariffs. (47.68-49.76)
 Trump  officials  are  attacking  India  every  day. (50.76-52.90)
 They  make  it  seem  like  it's  India  and  not  Russia. (53.00-55.38)
 That  invaded  Ukraine. (55.38-56.48)
 But  now  there  is  pushback. (57.20-58.76)
 Prominent  American  commentators  and  ex -officials  are  speaking  out. (59.38-63.14)
 Like  Nikki  Haley. (63.74-64.52)
 Nikki  Haley  was  Trump's  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations. (65.28-67.90)
 In  2024,  she  also  ran  for  president. (68.44-70.36)
 She  says  Trump's  policy  is  a  strategic  disaster. (70.94-74.10)
 In  fact,  let  me  quote  from  what  she  said. (75.14-76.90)
 India  must  be  treated  like  the  prized  free  and  democratic  partner  that  it  is. (77.52-81.92)
 Not  an  adversary  like  China. (82.26-83.72)
 Scutling  25  years  of  momentum  with  the  only  country  that  can  serve  as  a  counterweight  to  Chinese  dominance  in  Asia  would  be  a  strategic  disaster. (83.72-92.08)
 That's  what  Nikki  Haley  has  said. (93.82-95.06)
 And  she's  not  alone. (95.18-95.74)
 She  represents  the  conventional  thinking  in  Washington. (96.26-98.72)
 A  short  term  and  long  term  mission. (99.44-101.44)
 In  the  short  term,  the  US  needs  India  to  diversify  to  shift  supply  chains  from  China. (101.94-105.80)
 In  the  long  term,  the  US  needs  India  to  contain  China. (106.16-108.84)
 Again,  let  me  quote  Nikki  Haley. (109.48-111.26)
 Simply  put,  China's  ambitions  will  have  to  shrink  as  India's  power  grows. (111.26-116.74)
 Yet,  unlike  communist  control  China,  the  rise  of  a  democratic  India  does  not  threaten  the  free  world. (117.18-123.06)
 Then  you  have  John  Bolton. (124.18-125.48)
 He  was  Trump's  national  security  adviser  in  the  last  term. (126.06-128.62)
 He  too  is  cautioning  the  White  House. (128.82-130.56)
 This  is  what  he  said. (131.34-132.12)
 When  Trump  slapped  tariffs  on  India  for  buying  Russian  oil,  but  not  China,  which  also  purchases  Russian  oil,  it  may  have  pushed  India  further  into  the  Beijing  Moscow  axis. (132.86-143.52)
 This  lack  of  focus  by  the  Trump  administration  is  an  unforced  error. (143.94-147.52)
 Bolton  says  India  has  been  singled  out. (148.74-150.92)
 He  says  the  tariffs  are  inexplicable. (151.28-153.22)
 Another  US  analyst  went  a  step  ahead. (153.96-156.18)
 That's  Professor  Jeffrey  Sachs. (156.52-157.84)
 He  is  calling  these  tariffs  sabotage. (158.16-160.48)
 Also,  the  stupidest  tactical  move  in  US  foreign  policy. (160.72-164.34)
 Now,  clearly,  all  of  them  dislike  this  pivot. (165.08-167.16)
 But  do  they  have  fixes? (167.16-168.76)
 Nikki  Haley  does. (170.16-170.90)
 She  is  proposing  two  moves. (171.70-172.90)
 One  is  a  direct  meeting  between  Trump  and  Modi. (173.44-175.76)
 Both  men  have  a  good  equation. (175.96-177.20)
 She  is  betting  on  that  chemistry  to  pull  through. (177.78-180.44)
 The  second  is  devoting  more  diplomatic  resources  to  India,  like  they  do  with  China  and  our  Israel. (181.66-186.48)
 For  instance,  there  is  still  no  US  ambassador  in  India. (186.72-189.46)
 Joe  Biden's  appointee  has  left,  and  Trump  is  yet  to  name  his  successor. (190.10-193.98)
 Now,  we  partially  agree  with  these  views. (193.98-197.54)
 Yes,  the  India -U .S. (198.20-199.18)
 relationship  is  very  important. (199.30-200.52)
 It  should  not  be  abandoned  overnight. (200.90-202.42)
 That  seems  to  be  the  thinking  in  New  Delhi  as  well. (203.40-205.46)
 Despite  Trump's  attacks,  New  Delhi  has  been  calm. (206.48-208.98)
 No  outbursts,  no  stinging  rebuttals. (209.28-212.56)
 Instead,  India  has  responded  with  actions,  like  its  outreach  to  China. (213.56-218.36)
 It's  engagement  with  Russia. (219.32-220.40)
 There's  an  understanding  that  this  pivot  is  Trumpian. (221.02-224.76)
 It  is  not  a  nationwide  sentiment. (225.50-227.20)
 Having  said  that,  the  likes  of  Nikki  Haley  and  John  Bolton  must  realize  something. (228.06-231.06)
 We  are  not  here  to  be  pawns. (231.82-233.34)
 We  are  not  here  to  contain  China  or  to  be  your  bulwark  against  the  Communist  Party. (233.52-238.00)
 India's  policy  has  been  strategic  autonomy. (238.80-241.70)
 New  Delhi  works  with  every  major  world  power,  and  that  includes  the  United  States  of  America. (242.12-246.58)
 Do  not  interpret  that  as  interest  in  joining  the  U .S. (246.58-250.30)
 alliance,  because  India  is  not  open  to  that. (250.44-252.56)
 New  Delhi  was  never  going  to  abandon  Russia,  or  the  bricks,  or  the  global  south,  or  even  China  for  that  matter. (253.98-259.90)
 India  looks  at  relationships  on  their  merit. (260.58-263.06)
 I  don't  think  even  pro -India  American  voices  realize  that. (264.30-268.10)
 As  for  Donald  Trump,  he's  done  us  a  favor. (268.74-271.08)
 His  actions  have  brought  back  old  memories,  memories  of  America,  targeting,  and  sanctioning  India. (271.46-275.98)
 Memories  of  America  arming  Pakistan. (275.98-278.18)
 It  took  25  years  to  start  moving  on  from  that  bad  experience. (278.84-283.04)
 But  thanks  to  Donald  Trump,  we  are  back  to  square  one. (283.90-286.82)
