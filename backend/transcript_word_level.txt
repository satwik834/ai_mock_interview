 US (4.64-5.22)
 policy (5.22-5.74)
 in (5.74-5.94)
 six (5.94-6.22)
 months. (6.22-6.56)
 Conventional (6.84-7.38)
 wisdom (7.38-7.64)
 is (7.64-7.86)
 out. (7.86-8.10)
 Trumpian (8.60-8.90)
 logic (8.90-9.14)
 is (9.14-9.40)
 in. (9.40-9.58)
 It's (10.16-10.34)
 most (10.34-10.54)
 visible (10.54-11.02)
 in (11.02-11.48)
 his (11.48-11.64)
 India (11.64-11.96)
 policy. (11.96-12.46)
 You (13.34-13.42)
 see, (13.42-13.54)
 India (13.68-13.92)
 and (13.92-14.06)
 the (14.06-14.16)
 US (14.16-14.44)
 were (14.44-14.68)
 not (14.68-14.82)
 always (14.82-15.18)
 friends. (15.18-15.80)
 We (16.16-16.22)
 started (16.22-16.54)
 off (16.54-16.80)
 on (16.80-16.88)
 the (16.88-16.98)
 wrong (16.98-17.12)
 foot. (17.12-17.40)
 Washington (17.60-17.82)
 supported (17.82-18.30)
 Pakistan (18.30-18.76)
 in (18.76-19.00)
 the (19.00-19.12)
 20th (19.12-19.50)
 century (19.50-19.86)
 and (19.86-20.04)
 India (20.04-20.32)
 was (20.32-20.52)
 closer (20.52-20.82)
 to (20.82-20.98)
 Moscow. (20.98-21.34)
 Things (22.00-22.16)
 only (22.16-22.54)
 started (22.54-22.94)
 improving (22.94-23.30)
 in (23.30-23.52)
 the (23.52-23.60)
 1990s (23.60-24.44)
 when (24.44-24.52)
 the (24.52-24.62)
 cold (24.62-24.94)
 war (24.94-25.18)
 finally (25.18-25.74)
 ended. (25.74-26.32)
 Successive (26.90-27.46)
 governments (27.46-27.80)
 tried (27.80-28.20)
 to (28.20-28.42)
 deepen (28.42-28.64)
 ties (28.64-29.04)
 between (29.04-29.38)
 India (29.38-29.68)
 and (29.68-29.78)
 the (29.78-29.88)
 US. (29.88-30.12)
 They (30.34-30.40)
 tried (30.40-30.68)
 to (30.68-31.04)
 overcome (31.04-31.46)
 the (31.46-31.66)
 historical (31.66-32.12)
 roadblocks. (32.12-32.92)
 Enter (33.80-34.04)
 Trump (34.04-34.34)
 2 (34.34-34.60)
.0. (34.60-35.08)
 India (35.98-36.24)
 was (36.24-36.42)
 happy (36.42-36.72)
 to (36.72-36.88)
 see (36.88-37.04)
 him (37.04-37.18)
 return (37.18-37.46)
 to (37.46-37.64)
 the (37.64-37.72)
 White (37.72-37.88)
 House. (37.88-38.26)
 But (38.66-38.70)
 what (38.70-38.90)
 did (38.90-39.06)
 we (39.06-39.20)
 get (39.20-39.40)
 in (39.40-39.52)
 return? (39.52-39.80)
 Gripling (40.60-41.00)
 tariffs. (41.00-41.46)
 India (42.22-42.46)
 faces (42.46-42.84)
 25 (42.84-43.44)
% (43.44-43.90)
 reciprocal (43.90-44.28)

 buying (46.38-46.60)
 Russian (46.60-46.88)
 oil. (46.88-47.20)
 So (47.68-47.76)
 in (47.76-48.00)
 total, (48.00-48.36)
 50 (48.56-48.92)

 Trump (50.76-50.90)
 officials (50.90-51.32)
 are (51.32-51.52)
 attacking (51.52-51.86)
 India (51.86-52.20)
 every (52.20-52.60)
 day. (52.60-52.90)
 They (53.00-53.26)
 make (53.26-53.40)
 it (53.40-53.56)
 seem (53.56-53.74)
 like (53.74-53.90)
 it's (53.90-54.22)
 India (54.22-54.56)
 and (54.56-54.84)
 not (54.84-54.98)
 Russia. (54.98-55.38)
 That (55.38-55.72)
 invaded (55.72-56.06)
 Ukraine. (56.06-56.48)
 But (57.20-57.88)
 now (57.88-58.04)
 there (58.04-58.18)
 is (58.18-58.32)
 pushback. (58.32-58.76)
 Prominent (59.38-59.90)
 American (59.90-60.34)
 commentators (60.34-61.14)
 and (61.14-61.38)
 ex (61.38-61.58)

 are (62.28-62.34)
 speaking (62.34-62.70)
 out. (62.70-63.14)
 Like (63.74-63.86)
 Nikki (63.86-64.18)
 Haley. (64.18-64.52)
 Nikki (65.28-65.80)
 Haley (65.80-66.14)
 was (66.14-66.30)
 Trump's (66.30-66.62)

 to (66.96-67.22)
 the (67.22-67.32)
 United (67.32-67.50)
 Nations. (67.50-67.90)
 In (68.44-68.50)
 2024, (68.50-68.98)
 she (69.02-69.46)
 also (69.46-69.70)
 ran (69.70-69.84)
 for (69.84-70.00)
 president. (70.00-70.36)
 She (70.94-71.08)
 says (71.08-71.42)
 Trump's (71.42-72.06)
 policy (72.06-72.52)
 is (72.52-72.80)
 a (72.80-72.88)
 strategic (72.88-73.42)
 disaster. (73.42-74.10)
 In (75.14-75.20)
 fact, (75.20-75.34)
 let (75.34-75.52)
 me (75.52-75.62)
 quote (75.62-75.86)
 from (75.86-76.28)
 what (76.28-76.42)
 she (76.42-76.56)
 said. (76.56-76.90)
 India (77.52-77.80)
 must (77.80-78.14)
 be (78.14-78.42)
 treated (78.42-78.86)
 like (78.86-79.42)
 the (79.42-79.60)
 prized (79.60-80.06)
 free (80.06-80.28)
 and (80.28-80.40)
 democratic (80.40-80.74)
 partner (80.74-81.22)
 that (81.22-81.44)
 it (81.44-81.58)
 is. (81.58-81.92)
 Not (82.26-82.32)
 an (82.32-82.58)
 adversary (82.58-83.04)
 like (83.04-83.32)
 China. (83.32-83.72)
 Scutling (83.72-84.70)
 25 (84.70-85.26)
 years (85.26-85.48)
 of (85.48-85.60)
 momentum (85.60-86.04)
 with (86.04-86.30)
 the (86.30-86.44)
 only (86.44-86.74)
 country (86.74-87.22)
 that (87.22-87.42)
 can (87.42-87.58)
 serve (87.58-87.86)
 as (87.86-88.10)
 a (88.10-88.12)
 counterweight (88.12-88.70)
 to (88.70-88.96)
 Chinese (88.96-89.30)
 dominance (89.30-89.76)
 in (89.76-89.98)
 Asia (89.98-90.30)
 would (90.30-90.62)
 be (90.62-90.84)
 a (90.84-90.94)
 strategic (90.94-91.42)
 disaster. (91.42-92.08)
 That's (93.82-94.20)
 what (94.20-94.32)
 Nikki (94.32-94.46)
 Haley (94.46-94.68)
 has (94.68-94.88)
 said. (94.88-95.06)
 And (95.18-95.18)
 she's (95.18-95.36)
 not (95.36-95.46)
 alone. (95.46-95.74)
 She (96.26-96.40)
 represents (96.40-96.94)
 the (96.94-97.20)
 conventional (97.20-97.68)
 thinking (97.68-98.02)
 in (98.02-98.26)
 Washington. (98.26-98.72)
 A (99.44-99.54)
 short (99.54-99.80)
 term (99.80-100.16)
 and (100.16-100.56)
 long (100.56-100.78)
 term (100.78-101.08)
 mission. (101.08-101.44)
 In (101.94-102.02)
 the (102.02-102.10)
 short (102.10-102.30)
 term, (102.30-102.64)
 the (102.72-102.76)
 US (102.76-102.98)
 needs (102.98-103.24)
 India (103.24-103.48)
 to (103.48-103.64)
 diversify (103.64-104.22)
 to (104.22-104.46)
 shift (104.46-104.62)
 supply (104.62-105.00)
 chains (105.00-105.26)
 from (105.26-105.46)
 China. (105.46-105.80)
 In (106.16-106.22)
 the (106.22-106.32)
 long (106.32-106.54)
 term, (106.54-106.84)
 the (106.84-107.04)
 US (107.04-107.24)
 needs (107.24-107.54)
 India (107.54-107.88)
 to (107.88-108.10)
 contain (108.10-108.40)
 China. (108.40-108.84)
 Again, (109.48-109.82)
 let (109.98-110.06)
 me (110.06-110.26)
 quote (110.26-110.58)
 Nikki (110.58-110.92)
 Haley. (110.92-111.26)
 Simply (111.26-112.32)
 put, (112.32-112.80)
 China's (113.48-113.92)
 ambitions (113.92-114.30)
 will (114.30-114.64)
 have (114.64-114.82)
 to (114.82-115.02)
 shrink (115.02-115.28)
 as (115.28-115.60)
 India's (115.60-115.98)
 power (115.98-116.26)
 grows. (116.26-116.74)
 Yet, (117.18-117.36)
 unlike (117.82-118.14)
 communist (118.14-118.72)
 control (118.72-119.10)
 China, (119.10-119.58)
 the (119.94-120.00)
 rise (120.00-120.20)
 of (120.20-120.36)
 a (120.36-120.44)
 democratic (120.44-120.80)
 India (120.80-121.24)
 does (121.24-121.48)
 not (121.48-121.70)
 threaten (121.70-122.14)
 the (122.14-122.36)
 free (122.36-122.58)
 world. (122.58-123.06)
 Then (124.18-124.48)
 you (124.48-124.62)
 have (124.62-124.80)
 John (124.80-125.02)
 Bolton. (125.02-125.48)
 He (126.06-126.16)
 was (126.16-126.30)
 Trump's (126.30-126.66)
 national (126.66-126.88)
 security (126.88-127.42)
 adviser (127.42-127.78)
 in (127.78-128.04)
 the (128.04-128.12)
 last (128.12-128.32)
 term. (128.32-128.62)
 He (128.82-128.96)
 too (128.96-129.24)
 is (129.24-129.50)
 cautioning (129.50-129.92)
 the (129.92-130.06)
 White (130.06-130.26)
 House. (130.26-130.56)
 This (131.34-131.46)
 is (131.46-131.56)
 what (131.56-131.70)
 he (131.70-131.86)
 said. (131.86-132.12)
 When (132.86-133.00)
 Trump (133.00-133.34)
 slapped (133.34-133.96)
 tariffs (133.96-134.40)
 on (134.40-134.76)
 India (134.76-135.12)
 for (135.12-135.28)
 buying (135.28-135.50)
 Russian (135.50-135.78)
 oil, (135.78-136.14)
 but (136.74-136.82)
 not (136.82-137.06)
 China, (137.06-137.54)
 which (137.72-137.80)
 also (137.80-138.14)
 purchases (138.14-138.54)
 Russian (138.54-139.18)
 oil, (139.18-139.60)
 it (139.60-140.32)
 may (140.32-140.48)
 have (140.48-140.70)
 pushed (140.70-140.94)
 India (140.94-141.30)
 further (141.30-141.76)
 into (141.76-142.12)
 the (142.12-142.30)
 Beijing (142.30-142.56)
 Moscow (142.56-143.04)
 axis. (143.04-143.52)
 This (143.94-144.06)
 lack (144.06-144.30)
 of (144.30-144.46)
 focus (144.46-144.74)
 by (144.74-144.96)
 the (144.96-145.08)
 Trump (145.08-145.22)
 administration (145.22-145.78)
 is (145.78-146.24)
 an (146.24-146.42)
 unforced (146.42-147.16)
 error. (147.16-147.52)
 Bolton (148.74-149.10)
 says (149.10-149.30)
 India (149.30-149.62)
 has (149.62-149.80)
 been (149.80-149.92)
 singled (149.92-150.62)
 out. (150.62-150.92)
 He (151.28-151.36)
 says (151.36-151.52)
 the (151.52-151.70)
 tariffs (151.70-151.96)
 are (151.96-152.20)
 inexplicable. (152.20-153.22)
 Another (153.96-154.32)
 US (154.32-154.58)
 analyst (154.58-154.98)
 went (154.98-155.50)
 a (155.50-155.68)
 step (155.68-155.80)
 ahead. (155.80-156.18)
 That's (156.52-156.68)
 Professor (156.68-157.00)
 Jeffrey (157.00-157.30)
 Sachs. (157.30-157.84)
 He (158.16-158.40)
 is (158.40-158.52)
 calling (158.52-158.74)
 these (158.74-158.98)
 tariffs (158.98-159.30)
 sabotage. (159.30-160.48)
 Also, (160.72-161.06)
 the (161.14-161.24)
 stupidest (161.24-161.84)
 tactical (161.84-162.24)
 move (162.24-162.68)
 in (162.68-163.22)
 US (163.22-163.50)
 foreign (163.50-163.80)
 policy. (163.80-164.34)
 Now, (165.08-165.18)
 clearly, (165.34-165.54)
 all (165.94-166.08)
 of (166.08-166.18)
 them (166.18-166.34)
 dislike (166.34-166.70)
 this (166.70-166.94)
 pivot. (166.94-167.16)
 But (167.16-167.42)
 do (167.42-168.10)
 they (168.10-168.24)
 have (168.24-168.38)
 fixes? (168.38-168.76)
 Nikki (170.16-170.44)
 Haley (170.44-170.70)
 does. (170.70-170.90)
 She (171.70-171.82)
 is (171.82-171.98)
 proposing (171.98-172.28)
 two (172.28-172.58)
 moves. (172.58-172.90)
 One (173.44-173.60)
 is (173.60-173.96)
 a (173.96-174.10)
 direct (174.10-174.34)
 meeting (174.34-174.74)
 between (174.74-175.08)
 Trump (175.08-175.34)
 and (175.34-175.54)
 Modi. (175.54-175.76)
 Both (175.96-176.08)
 men (176.08-176.38)
 have (176.38-176.56)
 a (176.56-176.66)
 good (176.66-176.78)
 equation. (176.78-177.20)
 She (177.78-177.98)
 is (177.98-178.14)
 betting (178.14-178.40)
 on (178.40-178.64)
